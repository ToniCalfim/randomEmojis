# Randomize-Emoji-OOP
This JavaScript sample will randomize emojis for you.

A sample project to retrieve and display random emojis along with their names.

It was created in collaboration with my friend under the email `soulidbrasil@gmail.com`.

## HTML
The HTML file uses classes and ids for the tags.

## CSS
The CSS file uses tag, class, and pseudo-class selectors to style the page.

## JavaScript
The JavaScript file uses an OOP approach, utilizing features such as:
- Getters and setters
- Encapsulation
- Asynchronous functions to fetch data from an external API
- Template strings
- Element events
- Error handling
- Event-oriented automatic messages to create a better user experience.
